Add a Google Drive save button to your site

== Description ==

The Save to Drive button enables your web site to allow users to save files to their Google Drive account from an arbitrary URL via their browser. Hovering over the button will produce user details, similar to the +1 Google button.

To use simply use the the shortcode `[savetodrive]`. Two parameters can be used...

* url - This is required and specifies the full URL (absolute or relative) to the file to download.
* filename - Optional, this is the name that the file will be saved as. If not specified it will be assumed from the URL.

For example...

`[savetodrive url='http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/save-to-drive.1.0.zip' filename='save-to-drive-latest.zip' ]`

Alternatively, if adding to your theme you can use a PHP function call...

`<?php echo save_to_drive( 'http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/save-to-drive.1.0.zip', 'save-to-drive-latest.zip' ); ?>`

The above will perform the same function as the shortcode - again, the filename parameter is optional.

And that's it - the button will appear inline and you can style it separately.

**This plugin, and all support, is supplied for free, but [donations](http://artiss.co.uk/donate "Donate") are always welcome.**

1. Upload the entire `save-to-drive` folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' administration menu.
3. That's it, you're done - you just need to add the shortcode where you wish the button to appear!
